# Overview of Data

This dataset originally comes from the dataset available at [https://data.world/dhs/bia-indian-lands-dataset](https://data.world/dhs/bia-indian-lands-dataset). The modified dataset that I have created consists of 696 observations of 19 variables that give a snapshot of tribal lands in the United States in the late 2010s.

# Sources and Methodology

This data was compiled by the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Infrastructure Foundation and made available to the public in 2016.

# Missing Values

All missing values are designated with `NA`.
